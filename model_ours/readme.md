The current working code lives inside 'working code' directory. Everything in the 'testing code' directory is a huge mess. 

- Will need to update the paths to make sure the code runs. 

## Tasks

- ~~Read the new papers~~

- Look at options for passing a starting homography transformation instead of a rnadom seed. 
    - the part of the code that estimates homography takes in starting parameters
    - appy the homography from the previous frame and then calculating the homography transformation from that pre-warped image

- Take a video of a slightly reflective planar object.
- Another layer of homography estimation for higher resolution to get pixel perfect alignment.
